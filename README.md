# Y Shape Generator for Drawabox 250 Box Challenge

This is a simple Python tool that generates random **Y shapes**, intended to help artists practicing the [Drawabox 250 Box Challenge](https://drawabox.com/lesson/250boxes).  
The Y shape is a core component of the challenge, used to construct perspective boxes from three diverging lines at roughly 120Â° angles.

The tool uses **Tkinter** for the UI and **Turtle graphics** to draw the random Y shapes.  
Each click of the **Generate** button produces a new Y shape with random angles and line lengths.
